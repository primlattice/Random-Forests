Random Forests (Supervised machine learning)

File name: decision_tree_titanic.ipynb

An algorithm that classifies datasets (features of titanic passengers in this case) with high degree of accuracy. Method finds the optimal depth for the forest by fitting to a training set and then checking accuracies against a test set for multiple depths.

titanic.csv must be downloaded and saved in the same location as decision_tree_titanic.ipynb for the code to execute.

Installations required to run: python3, ipython, jupyter notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

Simply open in jupyter notebook and run all cells to execute the algorithm.
